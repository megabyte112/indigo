# indigo
An Operating System based on Arch Linux, designed to look good right out of the box.

Welcome to Indigo!

An Arch based Linux distro that is meant to look good right out of the box, with pre-configured BSPWM, DWM and Qtile** window managers respectfully,(with maybe more on the way) 
It will ship with: 
-The catppuccin gtk mocha theme with its own cursors and icons;
-a pre-configured polybar;
-pre-configured alacritty terminal;
-fully set up lightdm;
-mesa drivers for both Intel,AMD and Nvidia users;
-fully usable AUR through yay and pacman;
-and much more

Currently there is only a version of this where the iso will have to be compiled on your own accord but sooner or later we will release a precompiled version as well that will be ready for use and install.

However this is only test and cant really much be done as the installer is not yet finished.

Either way,
LONG LIVE INDIGO!
